Data science challenge for MiNODES internship position.

ML task: Supervised learning>Multi-calss classification problem.

Conclusion: Random forest performed best, however there is room for improvement.

For future enhancements: regularization, hyper parameter fine-tuning, optimization techniques, neural networks and deep-learning

Implemented with Python 3.6.2 :: Anaconda custom (64-bit)
Note that some results depend on randomization theefore might not be fully reproduceable.

Used libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, scipy, math, ast, time
